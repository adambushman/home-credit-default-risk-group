## Approach

I'm focusing on modeling for `TARGET` using the below method(s): 

1.  Penalized Regression


## Prep

Let's load a few libraries:

```{r}
library('tidyverse')
library('glmnet')
```

We'll load the cleaned, training data:

```{r}
data <- data.table::fread('data/application_train_clean.csv') |>
    as.data.frame()

glimpse(data)
```

All features in this file may conceivably be helpful in predicting `DEFAULT` (originally named `TARGET`), with exception of `SK_ID_CURR`. We do, however, have  little to no way of knowing which will be predictive. Therefore, an elastic net is probably the best choice.

Let's prepare the data:

```{r}
target <- data$DEFAULT
predictors <- as.matrix(
    data[,-which(names(data) == "DEFAULT")]
)
```
